h1. Lighthouse Stats

h2. How it works

The application is written using "Play Framework version 2.0.2":http://www.playframework.org/.

It uses the REST LightHouse API: http://help.lighthouseapp.com/kb/api

h2. Setup

In order to have access to the LightHouse API, you have to create a read-only token on the PlayHouse website: http://help.lighthouseapp.com/kb/api/how-do-i-get-an-api-token

Then, create a file called "lighthouse_api_token" in the "conf" folder, with the API key as content.
